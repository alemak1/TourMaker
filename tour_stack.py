#This module implements an algorithm (using a stack) to determine the quickest, least expensive,
or shortest paths among a set of tour stops

#Model the tour_stops as points in a graph, and the edges of the graph can be the
#expense or time between stops, so as to allow for optimization in terms of price and time
#from one point to another
