(1) Document all of the methods and data members for the tour_maker class. 
The current skeleton file defines function that comprise the minimal functionality
for the tour_maker class.  Existing functionality will be modified, and newer
functionality added as the project progresses.

(2) Overload the conversion operator for int so that a tour_object is convertible
to an integer that represents its total distance.  This way, several  tour_objects can
be converted to integers, sorted, and reconverted to the original tour objects.

(3) Overload the equality(==) and inequality(!=) operators so that the tour_objects
can be compared on the basis of their total distance
