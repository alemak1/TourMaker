(1) Document all of the methods and data members for the tour_maker class. 
The current skeleton file defines function that comprise the minimal functionality
for the tour_maker class.  Existing functionality will be modified, and newer
functionality added as the project progresses.

(2) Overload the conversion operator for int so that a tour_object is convertible
to an integer that represents its total distance.  This way, several  tour_objects can
be converted to integers, sorted, and reconverted to the original tour objects.

(3) Overload the += operator so that a new tour stop can be added to the tour_object


(4) Overload the equality(==) and inequality(!=) operators so that the tour_objects
can be compared on the basis of their total distance

(5) Overload the arithmetic addition operator so that two tour objects can be added together
resulting in a tour objects whose tours stops combine the tour stops of the operands

(6) Allow for user to specify additional criteria that can be added to the URL string
and allow for more detailed information to be pulled from the Google API

(7) Refactor data model logic so that additional information can be extracted from
the parsed JSON data returned from the API

(8) Place validators in their own class and objects of that class a stored property 
of the tour object
