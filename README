The tour_maker class is an API-client that allows users to connect to GoogleMaps
API to calculate the total distance going from one stop to another on a tour whose
stop-locations are passed as arguments to the API-client's initializer.  Users can
query the API-client for statistics about their tours, such as the total distance
going from one city to the next, in the order in which they were passed to the
initializer, as well as the total time required for the tour.
